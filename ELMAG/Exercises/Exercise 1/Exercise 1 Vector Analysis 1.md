## Exercise 1:
1. If q>0 then the magnetic force will be in the negative y-direction
2. If q<0 then the magnetic force wil be in the positive y-direction
3. If both fields are present, then sign of the charge doesnt matter for the total force cant be zero with these assumptions, as $v\times B$ and $E$ both point in negative y-direction, and both are multiplied by the same charge. $\pm q \cdot(-E) + (\pm q)\cdot (-VB) \neq 0$ 

## Exercise 2:
